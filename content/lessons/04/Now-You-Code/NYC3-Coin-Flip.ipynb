The program should output\nthe tally of heads and tails across the number of flips.\n\nFor Example:\nAfter 100000 flips. Heads: 50030, Tails 49970\n\nOf course, since the flips are random, the counts will vary each time the program executes.\n\nYour strategy should be to use a loop to flip a coin 100,000 times.\nAfter you flip you should check for heads or tails and increment the count\naccordingly.\n\n### How do you make Python simulate a coin flip?"

What it a definite or indefinite loop?\n\nAnswer:  This was a definite loop because there is only 1 execution for the code, it simply outputs the numbers for you.\n\n\n2. Modify this program to allow you to input the number of times you would like to flip the coin. NOTE: if you enter a large number, the program could take a few minutes to execute. Be Patient!!!\n\nAnswer:   I figured that you could not put a range on the number to allow the user to pick any number they desire with the same kinds of results as the previous code. This time, they get to pick the number.\n\n\n3. Explain how this progam could be modified to track flipping a \"three\" sided coin with `heads`, `tails` and `foos` for example? Do not modify the code, only explain your strategy.\n\nAnswer:  \n\nYou would have to add foos to the code as a variable, subtracting it by tails, and the program would have to divide it into 3 because all of the variables must be used.\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nThis assignment was a tougher one for me and took much more of my time, but I was able to figure it out without any help. It took alot of reading the syntax errors and looking very closely at anything I may have missed or anything that I can fix to make the code work as instructed. I now see that in order to let the user enter a number, you cannot do a specific range, it has to be 0 to the number that the user picked.\n"
