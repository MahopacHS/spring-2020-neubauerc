Whenever you guess, the computer will\ngive you a hint of higher or lower. This process repeats until you guess\nthe number, after which the computer reports the number of guesses it took you.\n\n```\nFor Example:\n\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10...\nYour guess: 5\nToo low. Guess higher.\nYour guess: 7\nToo high. Guess lower.\nYour guess: 6\nYou guessed it in 3 tries.\n```\n\nYour loop should continue until your input guess equals the\ncomputer generated random number.\n\n### How do you make Python generate a random number?

Was it a definite or indefinite loop?\n\nAnswer:   I used an indefinite loop for this to allow the person to get the correct answer. There is no definite number for this. They could type the same number twice if they wanted to.\n\n\n2. Modify this program to allow you to guess a number between 1 and 100. How much of your code did you need to change to make this work? \n\nAnswer:   you would only have to change the range in the random number generator and the print in the beginning to make it 100.\n\n\n3. This program is a good example of a difficult problem to conceptualize which has a simple solution when you look at actual lines of code. I assume you did not write this in a single try, so explain where you got stuck and describe your approach to overcoming it.\n\nAnswer:\nThis took me multiple times to get correct. I had to test different variables and ifs in order to get the correct outputs. I also had to fix the indentations multiple times. I just kept trying by editing the lines each time there was an error.\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nI did not need any help with this assignment. I was able to get to the correct code with patience and time. I am now fully understanding how you have to use loops and breaks and ifs. When you look at the lines of code, it seems quite simple, but is actually very complicated and time consuming.\n"
