Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases.\n\nAnswer:   it gives the crash code stating what went went wrong.\n\n\n2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values.\n\nAnswer:  it gives the crash code showing what went wrong. now, it tells you im really embarrassed but something went horribly wrong.\n\n\n3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example?\n\nAnswer:   You can use try and except in this example to stop the program from crashing. Instead it just gives the message to the user saying that something went wrong.\n\n\n4. How many times (at minimum) must we execute this program and check the results before we can be reasonably assured it is correct?\n\nAnswer:  for this one, I would say at least 7 times to test every line of code.\n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
